### üß∞ Prerequisites

You should have installed the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

## Setup

The following commands will get you up and running:

$ npm install
```

### Run

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

### Build

Build files will be placed in `./dist`.

```bash

To check that everything is ok after `npm build`, serve static files using [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve#readme) is recommended.

```bash

```
