## Install

```sh
npm install

## Deployment

Deployments happens through Github Actions CI/CD. When a version is ready for deployment, create a pull request for the release branch.
When the build is accepted, the deployment will automatically happen.

The website is currently hosted at Google Firebase on the Spark free tier plan.

## Follow the Development
