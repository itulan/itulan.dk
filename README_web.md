These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### 🧰 Prerequisites

The user should have installed the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To serve static build files, I recommend using [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve#readme).

Deployment happens through the Firebase CLI from the root folder.
