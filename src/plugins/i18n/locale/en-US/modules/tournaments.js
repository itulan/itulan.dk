Town of Salem is a social deduction game, similar to the classical Mafia and Werewolf, with a lot of added extra mechanics to make it a complex social deduction puzzle game. Just like in Werewolf, players are given a secret role, belonging to a certain team, the Town (the good guys), the Mafia (the bad guys) or the Neutrals (none of the above, have their own win conditions). Depending on the role they get, players must then either figure out the evils and lynch them through public vote if they are town or fool the Town into trusting them until taking over majority if they are evil. </br>Ready to compete against other compulsive liars in a Town of Salem tournament for prizes and bragging rights? Join our Town of Salem tournament during LAN!",
