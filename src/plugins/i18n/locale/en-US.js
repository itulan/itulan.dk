            "Greetings Planeswalkers: It's time to dddddddddddddduel! At LAN this year, the very first ITU LAN Championship in Magic: The Gathering will be held. The tournament will be using MTGA (Magic: The Gathering Arena), the new online client, and the format will be a Standard BO3 tournament. Each player will bring 1 deck. We are lucky enough that a Standard rotation has just happened at the time of the tournament, so we get to play with cards from the newest set: Throne of Eldraine! If we are lucky, the tournament will be streamed, and of course there are going to be amazing prizes for the winner!",
